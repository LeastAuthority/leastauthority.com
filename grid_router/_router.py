A self-reconfiguring proxy for TCP connections to Kubernetes pods runninig
Tahoe-LAFS introducers and storage server.

The proxy reconfigures itself based on Kubernetes Pods it observes to exist.

This module is used with ``twisted.application.service.ServiceMaker`` in

expose this code via ``twist`` and ``twistd``.
