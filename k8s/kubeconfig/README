This directory contains configuration files for kubectl.
They include endpoint and credential details to allow kubectl to work with our Kubernetes deployments.

The configuration files contain sensitive material which must remain confidential.
They are encrypted using sops.

To use the configuration, decrypt as many of the files as you want or need:

    $ sops -d k8s/kubeconfig/staging.enc.yaml > ~/.kube/staging.yaml

And set ``KUBECONFIG`` to refer to the files:

    $ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/staging.yaml:<more files if you want>

`kubectl` should now offer you additional contexts.
