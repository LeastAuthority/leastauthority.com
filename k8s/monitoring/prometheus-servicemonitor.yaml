# The _old_ idea of our Prometheus architecture is that applications will log
# to Fluentd and Fluentd will be configured with a Prometheus output plugin.
# It will construct the desired metrics data from the log stream and expose
# that data to Prometheus for collection.
#
# The new idea is that, because Fluentd configuration is so clunky and
# prometheus-operator is so good at going out and grabbing metrics from
# different pods, we'll have a bunch of service monitors that tell prometheus
# where to go look and let it do that and we'll shrink down Fluentd's role as
# much as possible.
