Yesterday LinuxBSDos.com featured S4 and LAFS in an `article on secure, distributed cloud storage`_. We had a bit of a quibble with the article's first line, though:

It's important to us to note that S4 and LAFS are not only meant to thwart mass government surveillance. We seek to protect against access by the *unauthorized*, not merely "the authorities". That means individual crackers, criminal organizations, corporate rivals, or non-PRISM-affiliated foreign governments just as much as the NSA! Least Authority is pro-security across the board.

There is no way that one could build an effective anti-government security system without excluding those other threats as well. Similarly, if law enforcement is authorized to see the data, then hackers also can see the data.
