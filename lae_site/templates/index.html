<h3>Our First Product, Tahoe-LAFS-on-S3</h3>
<p><em>Tahoe-LAFS-on-S3</em> is a reliable and scalable cloud storage back-end for use with the <a class="reference external" href="http://tahoe-lafs.org">Tahoe-LAFS.org</a> client software. Tahoe-LAFS is a Free Software, Open Source cloud storage system. It
encrypts and cryptographically integrity-checks your files for
<em>provider-independent security</em>. That means that the confidentiality
and integrity of your files cannot be violated by anyone&#45;not even
employees of the storage service provider.</p>

<h4>What is it good for?</h4>
<p>Securely backing up your data off-site. The <em>&quot;tahoe
backup&quot;</em> command inspects your local filesystem for files that have
changed since the last time you ran it. It uploads each file that
has changed and it creates a directory in Tahoe-LAFS to hold the
current &quot;snapshot&quot;—the current version of each of the files. You can
browse or access old versions just by browsing the old snapshot
directories.</p>

<h4>Where is the data stored?</h4>
<p>
Your data, encrypted, is stored on Amazon's Simple Storage Service
(<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3">S3</a>), which is a convenient, reliable, and widely understood
platform for storage.</p>
