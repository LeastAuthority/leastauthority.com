<h2>About Least Authority</h2>
<p>Least Authority was formed in 2011 to provide freedom-compatible storage. We are a small team who believe that <i>freedom matters</i> in storage technology. You can take advantage of online services while retaining control over your own data. We're here to make it easy.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>We are building an affordable, ethical, usable, and lasting data storage solution. We believe this requires Free and Open Source software, end-to-end cryptography, user-friendly interfaces, and a sustainable economic model.</p>

<p>Why do we do what we do? To give billions of humans a real alternative for control over their own data. If someone doesn't do this, then soon almost everyone will be beholden to a few large organizations that control all of their information.</p>
