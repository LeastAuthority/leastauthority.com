    <h3>How to use S4</h3>

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">1</span><a href="#signup">Subscribe</a> to S4.</h4>
        <p>You can do step two before or during this step.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">2</span><a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs/wiki/Installation">Install the free LAFS client</a> on your trusted machine.</h4>
        <p>Try running <span class="code">bin/tahoe --help</span> to check that the LAFS client is working. If you have any problems up to this point, <a href="https://tahoe-lafs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tahoe-dev">the tahoe-dev mailing list</a> or the <span class="code">#tahoe-lafs</span> IRC channel on irc.freenode.net are the best places to seek help.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">3</span>Create an LAFS gateway on your trusted machine.</h4>
        <p>To create a Tahoe-LAFS gateway on your trusted machine (in the default location, which is the <span class="code">.tahoe</span> subdirectory of your home directory), run:</p>
        <pre>
          bin/tahoe create-client</pre>
        <p>Then to configure the gateway for use with your LAE account, edit
        <span class="code">YOUR_HOME_DIRECTORY/.tahoe/tahoe.cfg</span> to use the following settings (the
        <span class="code">introducer.furl</span> will have been sent to you in your sign-up confirmation
        e-mail):</p>

        <pre>
        [client]
        introducer.furl = <i>specific to each customer</i>
        shares.needed = 1
        shares.happy = 1
        shares.total = 1</pre>

        <p>(If you are repurposing an existing node to use as the gateway, also set <span class="code">enabled = false</span> in
        the <span class="code">[storage]</span> section. It is already set that way when you create a node using
        <span class="code">bin/tahoe create-client</span>.)
    </div>
    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">4</span>Start your gateway.</h4>
        <p>Now start your gateway using:</p>
        <pre>
          bin/tahoe start</pre>
        <p>On Windows, you'll need to leave that command running; on other platforms
        it will run in the background. Next, in your web browser go to:</p>
        <pre>
          http://127.0.0.1:3456</pre>
        <p>to see the gateway's Welcome page. If everything is set up correctly, you
        should see a box with a green bullet on the left in the list of connected servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">5</span>Make an S4 alias.</h4>
        <p>We recommend that you create a directory and make the alias
        <span class="code">s4:</span> point to it:</p>
        <pre>
          bin/tahoe create-alias s4</pre>
        <p>then to see that directory in your browser:</p>
        <pre>
          bin/tahoe webopen s4:</pre>
        <p>(The colon after <span class="code">s4</span> is required here.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row-fluid">
        <h4><span class="number">6</span>Back up your files!</h4>
        <p>Just use the <span class="code">tahoe backup</span> command to back up your files to your new alias. For example:</p>
        <pre>
          bin/tahoe backup DIRECTORY_TO_BACKUP s4:</pre>
