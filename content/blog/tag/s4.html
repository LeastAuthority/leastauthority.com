<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.resetthenet.org/">“Reset The Net!”</a> is a broad coalition of many businesses, organizations, and individuals. We're empowering people to protect themselves on the Internet by using end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Least Authority is <a class="reference external" href="/about_us">a team of computer security professionals</a> dedicated to providing <em>freedom-compatible</em> storage. For us that means end-to-end-encryption and Free and Open Source code. Always.</p>
<p>In support of “Reset The Net!” we have upgraded our Secure Simple Storage Service (S4), reduced the price by 50%, and included <em>unlimited</em> personal data storage in the cloud.</p>
<p>S4 uses the Least Authority File System, a technology designed with
user security in mind, and built from the ground up to provide that security as well as we know how.</p>
<p>Such tools allow the user to store data on the Internet without any third party (even us!) breaching the confidentiality or integrity of the data. This keeps the power where it belongs, in the hands of the user.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce S4 as a command-line utility, and we are presently developing a Dropbox-esque friendly file-syncing utility named “Magic Folders”.</p>
<p>If you're comfortable with the command line, you can take part now with a free 30-day trial and continued service at half the previous price.
By using Least Authority's secure cloud storage service, you're becoming a supporter of the further development of the Free and Open Source crypto system,
and you're getting a great tool right now for your own use.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLrcsyHqrwQ">This video</a> demonstrates its use.</p>
<a href="/s4-subscription-form" class="btn btn-danger btn-large signup-button">Sign up!</a><p>Not familiar with the command line?</p>
<p>Don't worry we have a product in the works for you! Give us your email and we'll let you know when Magic Folders is ready!</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/about_us">Our mission</a> at LeastAuthority is to bring verifiable end-to-end
security to everyone.</p>
<p>As part of that mission, in addition to operating the <a class="reference external" href="https://leastauthority.com/product_s4">S4</a> simple secure
storage service, we also run a security consulting business. We
LeastAuthoritarians have extensive experience in security and
cryptography, and other companies pay us to analyze the security of their
protocols and software.</p>
<p>Almost all of our consulting clients are making Free and Open Source
software which protects user freedoms and works against censorship. It is
wonderful that in this day and age we can get paid to work on software in
the public interest.</p>
<p>One of our clients is <a class="reference external" href="https://spideroak.com/">SpiderOak</a>, a company who, like LeastAuthority,
sells cloud storage with end-to-end encryption. They didn't hire us to
evaluate the security of their current storage product (that would be a
big job!), but instead to do a limited, two-week long, security audit of
their new <a class="reference external" href="https://crypton.io/">Crypton.io</a> framework.</p>
<p>It was a fun project because we got to learn some of the details of the
<cite>Crypton.io</cite> design and implementation. We came away with a favorable
impression of the professionalism and good engineering practices of the
SpiderOak team. <cite>Crypton.io</cite> is all Free and Open Source software, and it
is designed for real, end-to-end security, which is part of why we wanted
to take the job.</p>
<p>Today SpiderOak <a class="reference external" href="https://spideroak.com/blog/20140220090004-responsibly-bringing-new-cryptography-product-market">has published the security auditing report</a>. We'd like
to thank them for producing <cite>Crypton.io</cite>, subjecting it to this kind of
independent review, and publishing the complete results. That's the right
way to do things!</p>
<p>The next security audit that we performed, was for the <a class="reference external" href="https://crypto.cat/">Cryptocat</a>
secure chat app. We expect the report from that to also be published
soon. Stay tuned!</p>

                    <p><a class="reference external" href="https://LeastAuthority.com">LeastAuthority.com</a> today announced <a class="reference external" href="https://LeastAuthority.com/product_s4/">Simple Secure Storage Service (S4)</a>, a backup service that encrypts your files to protect them from the prying eyes of spies and criminals.</p>
<p>“People deserve privacy and security in the digital data that make up our daily lives.” said the company's founder and CEO, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn. “As an individual or a business, you shouldn't have to give up control over your data in order to get the benefits of cloud storage.”</p>
<div class="section" id="verifiable-end-to-end-security">
<h2>Verifiable end-to-end security</h2>
<p>The Simple Secure Storage Service offers <em>verifiable</em> end-to-end security.</p>
<p>It offers “end-to-end security” because all of the customer's data is encrypted locally — on the customer's own personal computer — before it is uploaded to the cloud. During its stay in the cloud, it cannot be decrypted by LeastAuthority.com, nor by anyone else, without the decryption key which is held only by the customer.</p>
<p>S4 offers “<em>verifiable</em> end-to-end security” because all of the source code that makes up the Simple Secure Storage Service is published for everyone to see. Not only is the source code publicly visible, but it also comes with Free (Libre) and Open Source rights granted to the public allowing anyone to inspect the source code, experiment on it, alter it, and even to distribute their own version of it and to sell commercial services.</p>
<p>Wilcox-O'Hearn says “If you rely on closed-source, proprietary software, then you're just taking the vendor's word for it that it actually provides the end-to-end security that they claim. As the PRISM scandal shows, that claim is sometimes a lie.”</p>
<p>The web site of LeastAuthority.com proudly states “We can never see your data, and you can always see our code.”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trusted-by-experts">
<h2>Trusted by experts</h2>
<p>The Simple Secure Storage Service is built on a technology named “Least-Authority File System (LAFS)”. LAFS has been studied and used by computer scientists, hackers, Free and Open Source software developers, activists, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the U.S. National Security Agency.</p>
<p>The design has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific workshop: <em>Wilcox-O'Hearn, Zooko, and Brian Warner. “Tahoe: the least-authority filesystem.” Proceedings of the 4th ACM international workshop on Storage security and survivability. ACM, 2008.</em> <a class="reference external" href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/524.pdf">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/524.pdf</a></p>
<p>It has been cited in more than 50 scientific research papers, and has received plaudits from the U.S. Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, which stated: “Systems like Least-Authority File System are making these methods immediately usable for securely and availably storing files at rest; we propose that the methods be further reviewed, written up, and strongly evangelized as best practices in both government and industry.”</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Stallman, President of the <a class="reference external" href="https://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> said “Free/Libre software is software that the users control. If you use only free/libre software, you control your local computing — but using the Internet raises other issues of freedom and privacy, which many network services don't respect. The Simple Secure Storage Service is an example of a network service that does respect your freedom and privacy.”</p>
<p>Jacob Appelbaum, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor project</a> developer and <a class="reference external" href="https://wikileaks.org/">WikiLeaks</a> volunteer, said “LAFS's design acknowledges the importance of verifiable end-to-end security through cryptography, Free/Libre release of software and transparent, peer-reviewed system design.”</p>
<p>The LAFS software is already packaged in several widely-used operating systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu.</p>
